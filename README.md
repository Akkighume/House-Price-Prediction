# House-Price-Prediction #

# Project Description

In this project we will create a machine learning model with linear regression on Boston
housing dataset. This model will aid us in making better real estate decisions by making
house price predictions in that area. For this we will carryout data exploration for better
understanding of data and will require preprocessing to improve the model accuracy.

# Project Context

In machine learning we write computer programs which automatically improve with
experience which are termed as machine learning models. It saves us from explicitly
writing code for complex real world data.
In this project we are going to use supervised learning, which is a branch of machine
learning where we teach our model by examples. Here we will first explore different
attributes of Boston housing dataset then a part of dataset will be used to train the linear
regression algorithm after that we will use the trained model to give predictions on
remaining part of dataset.

# Prerequisite(s)
